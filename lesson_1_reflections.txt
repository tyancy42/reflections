How did viewing a diff between two versions of
a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It saved time by allowing me to quickly assess
what the issue was.

How could having easy access to the entire history
of a file make you a more efficient programmer in
the long term?

Any mistakes made could be easily discovered and
rectified.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs
does?

The biggest pro of manually saving is having your commits
make sense rather than being commited mid-change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git saves files together because logically programs can
be made up of multiple files and saving them separately
doesn't make sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view
the history of files?

I...put them into Git?

How might using version control make you more confident
to make changes that could break something?

You could make riskier moves because in the event of a
break, you could simply revert the changes instead of
trying to remember them and redoing them by hand.
